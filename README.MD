# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

The motivation for this project was to provide the user with an accessible website, so that people with disabilities can access it using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. I solved the client and user's accessibility needs by providing HTML semantics, making sure all links function correctly, providing comments in the CSS code and consolidating selectors and properties for an easier flow to the code.

I learnt about code refractoring, semantics (including hierarchy and accessibility needs), linking HTML code properly to CSS, classes and ID's, how to leave code a little cleaner than it was found, how to use the Google Dev Tools, alt text, commenting in code, and much more.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
