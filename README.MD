# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

The motivation for this project was to provide the user with an accessible website, so that people with disabilities can access it using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. I solved the client and user's accessibility needs by providing HTML semantics, making sure all links function correctly, providing comments in the CSS code and consolidating selectors and properties for an easier flow to the code.

I learnt about code refractoring, semantics (including hierarchy and accessibility needs), linking HTML code properly to CSS, classes and ID's, how to leave code a little cleaner than it was found, how to use the Google Dev Tools, alt text, commenting in code, and much more.
